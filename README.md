# Reverse dictionary 
This is my first Python script. It gives you a definition, and you have to guess the word.

***Prerequisites:*** python3 randomwords britannica-dictionary (both of the latter are python libraries)

**To play**

Download the script and the python libraries then run it in the terminal.
